# Car Price Prediction (AutoTrader Dataset)

This project predicts used car prices using machine learning models.
The dataset is based on AutoTrader listings and is not included in this repository due to data privacy restrictions.

## What I did
- Cleaned and preprocessed a large real-world dataset
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Applied feature engineering and encoding techniques
- Trained and compared multiple regression models
- Used ensemble methods to improve performance

## Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Voting Regressor
- Stacking Regressor

## Model Analysis
- Feature importance analysis
- SHAP-based interpretation
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Clustering for feature exploration

## Tools
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas
- SHAP

## Notes
- The AutoTrader dataset is used for academic purposes only
- Raw data is not shared due to confidentiality
- Experiments were implemented in a Google Colab notebook
